* [#54] Added DataMapper 0.9.3 support
* [#24] Added mack-mailer support.
* Added a rake tmp:clear task.
* [#48] rake generator:list now displays the correct names for the generator tasks.
* [#46] Calling .to_param on nil now raises a NoMethodError exception.
* [#47] rake gems:* tasks now work, and no longer require mack_ruby_core_extensions
* [#18] Added Page caching. All that's needed for using page caching is to require the mack-caching gem, turn on
  page caching in your config files with: 
    use_page_caching: true
  and, in your controllers, specify which pages you would like cached with the cache_pages directive:
    cache_pages :only => [:index, :show] # you can also use :except
* [#43] Added a Mack::Utils::Registry class to allow for easy creation of registries.
* [#44] Mack::Runner has now been extended to allow for greater extension flexibility.

* [#38] There is now a registry of Controllers that are in the system.
* [#36] Renamed the initialize method in the Mack::Controller module to configure_controller. This gives
  control of the initialize method back to the class.
* [#31] Added support for ruby-debug.
* [#33] mack-active_record now requires ActiveRecord 2.0.2 explicitly, not >=2.0.2
* [#34] Mack::l10n now raises exception with a fully qualified name.
* [#7] Added support for Extlib::Hook in a few places.

* [#49] mack-data_mapper:  mack-data_mapper.rb will require mack-data_mapper_tasks.rb
* [#49] Updated warning message if orm is defined in app_config (i.e. user only needs to require mack-[orm_name], instead of both that and mack-[orm_name]_tasks).
* [#50] Mack will now have 2 environment files: mack_core and mack_app.  Mack.rb will load both files, but it gives other module a chance to load just the core files and not the application's files.
* [#51] Application generator should generate orm support in the right place
* [#52] mack-more: mack-[orm] should require mack-[orm].rb using its full path.
* gem: application_configuration 1.5.1

  Test::Unit::TestCase add the following config parameter to your config/app_config/default.yml file:
  mack::testing_framework: test_case

===0.5.5.2
* Fixed an issue where if there are no parameters for render(:url) it will blow up.

===0.5.5.1
* Generated applications were still being generated with @content_for_layout instead of yield_to :view in application.html.erb.

===0.5.5
* INCOMPATIBILITY NOTICE: Ripped apart the ENTIRE rendering engine and rewrote it from the ground up. This means that wherever you are using 'render' calls in your views and controllers need to be changed. The new format is render(type, value, options). Examples: render(:action, :show), render(:url, "http://www.mackframework.com"), etc...
* INCOMPATIBILITY NOTICE: Files named *.xml.erb need to be changed to *.xml.builder to use the Builder::XmlMarkup library. If you leave the .erb extension on there the file will be run through Erubis.

* render(:url) now recognizes 'local' urls and tries to run them through the app, mimicking most headers from the original request.
* Added 'options' banners to the mack and mack_ring_server binaries.
* gem: genosaurus 1.1.8
* gem: mack_ruby_core_extensions 0.1.28
* gem: markaby 0.5.0
* gem: mack-data_mapper 0.5.5

* gem: mack_ruby_core_extensions 0.1.23
* gem: genosaurus 1.1.4
* gem: datamapper 0.3.2
* gem: rcov 0.8.1.2.0
* gem: mack-data_mapper 0.5.0

===0.4.7
* Added Mack::Request::UploadedFile class to make dealing with file uploads easy.

* Added rake generator:list task to list all the available generators.

* Rake tasks in plugins now show up in the Rake tasks list.
* All generators, including the 'mack' binary are now using Genosaurus.

* gem: thin 0.8.1
* gem: genosaurus 1.1.1

===0.4.6
* Mack now uses Erubis, http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/, for it's rendering engine instead of ERB. This makes Mack even faster now! Yippie!
* Added rake generate:model name=<model_name> (optional: cols=<col_1>:<col_1_type>,<col_2>:<col_2_type>) This will also create a migration for you.
* Updated rake generate:migration name=<model_name> (optional: cols=<col_1>:<col_1_type>,<col_2>:<col_2_type>) This will create the proper table migration for you.

* Fixed a bug with request logging not, well, logging.
* gem: erubis 2.5.0
* gem: thin 0.8.0

===0.4.5
* Removed boot.rb file. It was unnecessary.
* When a new Mack application is generated the Rakefile that gets generated is stamped with the Mack gem version used to create it. This ties the project to that gem. This can, of course, be upgraded as new Mack gems come out, but it's a good way of tying your app to a specific revision of Mack.
* Added support for migrations for both ActiveRecord and DataMapper. DataMapper migration support requires DataMapper 0.3.0 gem. Please keep in mind, though, that DataMapper 0.3.0 has a serious bug in it, which may prevent you from using it. Please see http://www.mackframework.com/2008/04/09/horrible-bug-in-datamapper-030/ for more information.
* Rewrote distributed routing support to use Rinda inside of plain old DRb. This makes for an almost zero configuration usage.

* redirect_to now takes an optional Hash as a second parameter, instead of a fixnum.
* redirect_to will now do server side redirects if passed :server_side => true as part of the optional second argument Hash.
* plugin in support. plugins get loaded before the 'app' directory. each plugins 'lib' directory is added to the global load path and then each plugins 'init.rb' file is called, which is responsible for loading the necessary files. The 'lib' directories are finally removed from the global load path.
* renamed initialize directory to initialization. moved logging, orm_support, and plugins to a subfolder called initializers.
