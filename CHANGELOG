===0.5.5.4
* Fixed the damn Lint error some people were facing! 

===0.5.5.3
* Restored compatibility with Passenger and the next version of Thin.
* Fixed 'requires' out of order in certain flavors or unix. Hopefully.

===0.5.5.2
* Fixed an issue where if there are no parameters for render(:url) it will blow up.

===0.5.5.1
* Generated applications were still being generated with @content_for_layout instead of yield_to :view in application.html.erb.

===0.5.5
* INCOMPATIBILITY NOTICE: Ripped apart the ENTIRE rendering engine and rewrote it from the ground up. This means that wherever you are using 'render' calls in your views and controllers need to be changed. The new format is render(type, value, options). Examples: render(:action, :show), render(:url, "http://www.mackframework.com"), etc...
* INCOMPATIBILITY NOTICE: Files named *.xml.erb need to be changed to *.xml.builder to use the Builder::XmlMarkup library. If you leave the .erb extension on there the file will be run through Erubis.
* INCOMPATIBILITY NOTICE: <%= @content_for_layout %> is now <%= yield_to :view %>
* Added Markaby support.
* Added Haml support.
* Added content_for and yield_to methods in views.
* Erubis compiled templates are now cached for increased performance.
* Added render(:inline) and render(:template) support.
* Refactored, and reorganized some files to clean up the gem.
* Fixed bug with cookies not merging with configured app_config parameters.
* Added mime-types. The 'Content-Type' header is now being set based on the format that is requested. Default is text/html.
* Fixed r.defaults in routes so they are always the last routes to be checked, no matter where they are placed in the routes definitions.
* render(:url) now recognizes 'local' urls and tries to run them through the app, mimicking most headers from the original request.
* Added 'options' banners to the mack and mack_ring_server binaries.
* gem: genosaurus 1.1.8
* gem: mack_ruby_core_extensions 0.1.28

===0.4.7
* Added Mack::Request::UploadedFile class to make dealing with file uploads easy.
* Fixed bug where if a controller didn't exist it wasn't checking the public directory.
* Generated DataMapper models no longer extend DataMapper::Base, but rather 'include DataMapper::Persistence'. This corresponds to the 0.9.0 upcoming release of DataMapper.
* Fixed a bug in request.params that was making file uploads into strings.
* Namespaced resourced routes, such as Admin::UserController, now work.
* Added rake generator:list task to list all the available generators.
* scaffold generator now creates a stub functional test.

===0.4.6
* Mack now uses Erubis, http://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/, for it's rendering engine instead of ERB. This makes Mack even faster now! Yippie!
* Added rake generate:model name=<model_name> (optional: cols=<col_1>:<col_1_type>,<col_2>:<col_2_type>) This will also create a migration for you.
* Updated rake generate:migration name=<model_name> (optional: cols=<col_1>:<col_1_type>,<col_2>:<col_2_type>) This will create the proper table migration for you.

* Overall general refactoring of the generator classes.
* Fixed a bug with request logging not, well, logging.
* gem: erubis 2.5.0
* gem: thin 0.8.0

===0.4.5
* Removed boot.rb file. It was unnecessary.
* When a new Mack application is generated the Rakefile that gets generated is stamped with the Mack gem version used to create it. This ties the project to that gem. This can, of course, be upgraded as new Mack gems come out, but it's a good way of tying your app to a specific revision of Mack.
* Added support for migrations for both ActiveRecord and DataMapper. DataMapper migration support requires DataMapper 0.3.0 gem. Please keep in mind, though, that DataMapper 0.3.0 has a serious bug in it, which may prevent you from using it. Please see http://www.mackframework.com/2008/04/09/horrible-bug-in-datamapper-030/ for more information.
* Rewrote distributed routing support to use Rinda inside of plain old DRb. This makes for an almost zero configuration usage.
* Added: mack_ring_server binary to start a Rinda ring server for use with distributed routing.
* Sqlite3 is now the default database for Mack applications configured with ORM support.
* Added a test helper method, rake_task, to aid in the testing of Rake tasks.

* plugin in support. plugins get loaded before the 'app' directory. each plugins 'lib' directory is added to the global load path and then each plugins 'init.rb' file is called, which is responsible for loading the necessary files.
