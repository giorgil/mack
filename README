=Hello, and welcome to Mack!

Mack is a Ruby web application framework. It takes the best ideas from several frameworks, including Rails, Merb, and Ramaze, and tries to improve upon those ideas. Mack uses Rack[http://rack.rubyforge.org] as an abstraction layer to separate itself from it's deployment.

Mack is also about performance. Because Mack uses technologies like Thin[http://code.macournoyer.com/thin] and Rack[http://rack.rubyforge.org], Mack is a multithreaded and fast framework. Current tests show Mack/Thin[http://code.macournoyer.com/thin] is twice as fast as Rails/Mongrel. Mack tries to strip out a lot of the cruft from other frameworks, like Rails, and delivers you a fast, efficient framework designed for actual real world development.

==Installation
  $ sudo gem install mack

==Getting Started
First things first, let's generate your application:
  $ mack <app_name>

To run a Mack application:
  $ mackery server

mackery server takes the following options:
  $ mackery server -p <port> -e <environment> -h <rack_handler>
  
The rack_handler one will allow you to switch which server is used to run the app. See Rack for more Rack::Handlers.
  
You can also run:
  $ mackery console
  
This will give you console level access to your application.
