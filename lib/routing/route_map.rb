    # Routes are the back bone of the Mack framework. They are used to map incoming urls to controllers.
    #
    # === Defining Routes:
    # Example:
    #   Mack::Routes.build do |r|
    #
    #     # Connects "/" to the HomeController and the '/' action.
    #     r.connect "/", :controller => :home
    # 
    #     # Connects "/foo", to the HomeController and the 'foo' action.
    #     r.connect "/foo", :controller => :home, :action => :foo
    #
    #     # Connects "/blog" to the BlogController and the 'list' action.
    #     r.connect "/blog", :controller => :blog, :action => :list
    # 
    #     # Connects "/blog/:id" to the BlogController and the 'index' action.
    #     # It will also take the second half of the url and map it to a parameter called :id.
    #     # Example:
    #     #   '/blog/1' # => goes to the BlogController, 'index' action, and has an :id parameter == 1.
    #     r.connect "/blog/:id", :controller => :blog, :action => :index
    # 
    #     # Connects "/blog/create" to the BlogController and the 'create' action.
    #     # It also insists that the HTTP method be 'post'. If it's not 'post' it will not match this route.
    #     r.connect "/blog/create", :controller => :blog, :action => :create, :method => :post
    # 
    #     # Connects "/comment/destroy/:id" to the CommentController and the 'destroy' action.
    #     # It also insists that the HTTP method be 'delete'. If it's not 'delete' it will not match this route.
    #     # It will also create an :id parameter.
    #     r.connect "/comment/destroy/:id", :controller => :comment, :action => :destroy, :method => :delete
    #
    #     # This will create 'RESTful' routes. Unlike Rails, it doesn't generate a mixture of singular/plural
    #     # routes. It uses whatever you pass in to it. This will also create named routes in Mack::Routes::Urls.
    #     # Examples:
    #     #   '/users' # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :index, :method => :get} 
    #     #            # => users_index_url
    #     #            # => users_index_full_url
    #     #   '/users' # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :create, :method => :post} 
    #     #            # => users_create_url
    #     #            # => users_create_full_url
    #     #   '/users/new' # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :new, :method => :get} 
    #     #                # => users_new_url
    #     #                # => users_new_full_url
    #     #   '/users/:id' # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :show, :method => :get} 
    #     #                # => users_show_url
    #     #                # => users_show_full_url
    #     #   '/users/:id/:edit # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :edit, :method => :get} 
    #     #                     # => users_edit_url
    #     #                     # => users_edit_full_url
    #     #   '/users/:id # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :update, :method => :put} 
    #     #                      # => users_update_url
    #     #                      # => users_update_full_url
    #     #   '/users/:id # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :delete, :method => :delete} 
    #     #               # => users_delete_url
    #     #               # => users_delete_full_url
    #     r.resource :users
    # 
    #     # This will redirect '/old_users/show/:id' to '/users/:id' with a status of 302, 'Moved Temporarily'.
    #     # Examples:
    #     #   '/old_users/show/1' # => '/users/1' (status of 302)
    #     #   '/old_users/show/1?foo=bar' # => '/users/1?foo=bar' (status of 302)
    #     r.connect '/old_users/show/:id', :redirect_to => "/users/:id"
    # 
    #     # This will redirect '/old_blog' to '/blog' with a status of 301, 'Moved Permanently'.
    #     # Examples:
    #     #   '/old_blog' # => '/blog' (status of 301)
    #     #   '/old_blog?foo=bar' # => '/blogfoo=bar' (status of 301)
    #     r.connect '/old_blog', :redirect_to => "/blog", :status => 301
    # 
    #     # Connects "/comment/update/:id" to the CommentController and the 'update' action.
    #     # It will also create an :id parameter.
    #     # It will also create a named route in Mack::Routes::Urls called, 'c_u_url'.
    #     # In a controller or a view this: c_u_url(:id => 1) would return '/comment/update/1'.
    #     # It will also create a named route in Mack::Routes::Urls called, 'c_u_full_url'.
    #     # In a controller or a view this: c_u_full_url(:id => 1) would return 'http://example.org/comment/update/1'.
    #     r.c_u "/comment/update/:id", {:controller => :comment, :action => :update}
    #
    #     # This creates 'Rails' style routes.
    #     # Any requests that come in that aren't found by explicit routes, will fall into these routes.
    #     # '/:controller/:action'
    #     # '/:controller/:action/:id'
    #     #
    #     # Example:
    #     #   '/comment/show/1' # => Goes to CommentController, the 'show' action, with a parameter of 1.
    #     r.defaults
    #   
    #   end
    # 
    # === Named Routes:
    #   Mack::Routes.build do |r|
    #     r.resource :users
    #   end
    # See above in 'Defining Routes' to see what fully gets created when you map a resource, but let's look
    # at the named route stuff that gets generated. In particular let's look at one example:
    #   '/users/:id' # => {:controller => 'users', :action => :show, :method => :get} 
    #                # => users_show_url
    #                # => users_show_full_url
    # The following can be used in controllers, views, and tests:
    #   users_show_url(:id => 1) # => '/users/1'
    #   # The following can only be used when there is a @request (Mack::Request) instance variable around:
    #   users_show_full_url(:id => 1) # => 'http://example.org/users/1' 
    # 
    #   Mack::Routes.build do |r|
    #     r.hello_world "/", :controller => :home_page, :action => :hello
    #   end
    # This will give you the following two methods:
    #   hello_world_url # => "/"
    #   hello_world_full_url # => "http://example.org/"
    # These methods act just like the ones created when you use the resource method.
    # 
    # === Exception Routes:
    # You can define a route that will catch exceptions that are raised in other controllers.
    # 
    #   Mack::Routes.build do |r|
    #     r.handle_error Mack::ResourceNotFound, :controller => :oops, :action => :404
    #     r.handle_error HollyCrapError, :controller => :oops, :action => :500
    #   end
    # In the example if an action raises a Mack::ResourceNotFound it will be caught and rendered
    # using the OopsController and the 404 action.
    # If A HollyCrapError is thrown it will be caught and rendered using the OopsController and the 500 action.
    # You can catch all exceptions using Exception.
